## 1. Pseudocode Standard
* 用伪代码描述将十进制转换成16进制的方法  
```
    INPUT number x
    For number x DO
        a = x divide 16
        b = the surplus
        x = a
        store b to an array
    UNTIL a = 0
    PRINT the array in inverse order
```
* C语言实现
```
    #include<stdio.h>
    #include<math.h>
    int main(){
        int num,surplus,result[100],n,x; //result[]大小可调节
        int i = 0;
        scanf("%d",&num);//input number
        do{
            surplus = num % 16;
            result[i] = surplus;//将余数储存在数组之中           
            i++;
            num = num / 16;
        }while(num > 0);
        for(n = i - 1;n >= 0;n--){
            x = result[n];
            if(abs(x) >= 0&&abs(x) <= 9)
                printf("%d",x);
            else
                printf("%c",x + 55);//将10-15转换为A-E
        } //将数组倒序输出
           
        return 0;

    }
```

## 2. 名词解释与对比
* #### Top-down design
strategie of information processing and knowledge ordering, used in a variety of fields including software, humanistic and scientific theories (see systemics), and management and organization. In practice, it can be seen as a style of thinking, teaching, or leadership.  
A top-down approach (also known as stepwise design and in some cases used as a synonym of decomposition) is essentially the breaking down of a system to gain insight into its compositional sub-systems in a reverse engineering fashion. In a top-down approach an overview of the system is formulated, specifying, but not detailing, any first-level subsystems. Each subsystem is then refined in yet greater detail, sometimes in many additional subsystem levels, until the entire specification is reduced to base elements. A top-down model is often specified with the assistance of "black boxes", which makes it easier to manipulate. However, black boxes may fail to clarify elementary mechanisms or be detailed enough to realistically validate the model. Top down approach starts with the big picture. It breaks down from there into smaller segments.

* #### Work breakdown structure
A work-breakdown structure (WBS) in project management and systems engineering, is a deliverable-oriented breakdown of a project into smaller components. A work breakdown structure is a key project deliverable that organizes the team's work into manageable sections. The Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK 5) defines the work-breakdown structure "A hierarchical decomposition of the total scope of work to be carried out by the project team to accomplish the project objectives and create the required deliverables."  
A work-breakdown structure element may be a product, data, service, or any combination thereof. A WBS also provides the necessary framework for detailed cost estimating and control along with providing guidance for schedule development and control.

* Top-down design ：从顶端向下进行设计  
  WBS ：将事物分成一个个小的、易于管理的部分进行操作  
  同 ：都是分析问题、实现目标的方法

1.  ```
    选择洗衣模式；  
    注水；
    加入洗衣液；
    浸泡；
    循环    电机顺时针旋转；  
            电机逆时针旋转；
    排水；
    脱水；
    关机；
    ```
2. ```
    INPUT mode;//模式决定水位，时间等条件

    WHILE(water < modeWater)
        water_in_switch(open)

    halt(returncode)
    ```
3. 用户目标 ：
    * 正常洗衣 ：对时间要求不严格，希望彻底的清洗衣服的污渍。  
    * 快速洗衣 ：对时间要求严格，对污渍的清晰程度要求不高。  
    程序区别 ：快速洗衣的浸泡时间缩短，洗衣时电机转动次数减少，甩干强度减小。  
    改进 ：快速洗的时候加大洗衣液的量，保证洗衣质量。
