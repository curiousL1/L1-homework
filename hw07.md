* CPU从存储器中读码（fetch）保存在自己的储存空间（registers），然后它进行解码（decode），然后读取所需数据并按要求进行运作（get data & execute），并开始下一轮读码（fetch）。
* 
1. IR ：指令寄存器，储存正在运行的指令。
2. PC ：程序计数器，包含当前执行的指令的地址，并在其获取之后指向下一指令。
3. ACC ：累加器，一种储存计算产生的中间结果的寄存器，使其不需要被写入内存，加快速度。
* a和c是标识符，指代其代表的内存单元的地址。

## 2. 
* 内存暂存CPU中的运算数据，以及与外存储器交换的数据。
* 可以
* Instruction Format规定了一条指令（ 每个bit ）的布局。  
例如：0001 0000 00000001  
0001代表操作数是数值  
0000（操作码）代表是ADD操作  
00000001代表操作数为1

* ### 汇编语言（Assembly Language）  
An assembly (or assembler) language, often abbreviated asm, is any low-level programming language in which there is a very strong correspondence between the program's statements and the architecture's machine code instructions.
* ### 编译（Compiler）  
A compiler is computer software that primarily translates computer code from a high-level programming language to machine code to create an executable program. A compiler can also be used to convert computer code written in one programming language into another programming language. Technically compilers are a type of translator that support digital devices, primarily computers.
* ### 命令式语言（Imperative programming）  
In computer science, imperative programming is a programming paradigm that uses statements that change a program's state. In much the same way that the imperative mood in natural languages expresses commands, an imperative program consists of commands for the computer to perform. Imperative programming focuses on describing how a program operates.
* ### 函数编程语言（Functional programming）  
In computer science, functional programming is a programming paradigm—a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs—that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data. It is a declarative programming paradigm, which means programming is done with expressions or declarations instead of statements.
* ### 过程式编程（Procedural programming）
Procedural programming is a programming paradigm, derived from structured programming, based upon the concept of the procedure call. Procedures, also known as routines, subroutines, or functions, simply contain a series of computational steps to be carried out. Any given procedure might be called at any point during a program's execution, including by other procedures or itself.
