### 5. 名词解释
* ### CPU  
A central processing unit (CPU) is the electronic circuitry within a computer that carries out the instructions of a computer program by performing the basic arithmetic, logical, control and input/output (I/O) operations specified by the instructions. 
* ### RAM  
Random-access memory (RAM) is a form of computer data storage that stores data and machine code currently being used.
* ### ROM  
Read-only memory (ROM) is a type of non-volatile memory used in computers and other electronic devices. Data stored in ROM can only be modified slowly, with difficulty, or not at all, so it is mainly used to store firmware (software that is closely tied to specific hardware, and unlikely to need frequent updates) or application software in plug-in cartridges.
* ### BUS(computing)  
In computer architecture, a bus is a communication system that transfers data between components inside a computer, or between computers.
* ### Parallel Computing  
Parallel computing is a type of computation in which many calculations or the execution of processes are carried out simultaneously.
